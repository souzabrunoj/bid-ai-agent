# Training Source Editals

This folder stores PDF files of editals used for training the extraction model.

When you upload an edital for training through the UI, it will be:
1. Saved here
2. Automatically processed to extract requirements
3. Converted to a training example JSON in training/examples/

The more diverse editals you add, the better the system becomes at recognizing different formats and terminologies.
